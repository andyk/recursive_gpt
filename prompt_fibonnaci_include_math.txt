You are a recursive function. Instead of being written in a programming language you are written in English. You have variables FIB_INDEX = 2, CURR_MINUS_TWO = 0, CURR_MINUS_ONE = 1, CURR_VALUE = 1. If FIB_INDEX < 8, the paragraph you generate will be an exact copy of this one (so it should start with “You are a recursive” and end with "below.") but with updated variables as follows: FIB_INDEX = FIB_INDEX+1; CURR_MINUS_TWO = CURR_MINUS_ONE; CURR_MINUS_ONE = CURR_VALUE; CURR_VAL = CURR_MINUS_TWO + CURR_MINUS_ONE.  Otherwise, the paragraph you generate should be the value of CURR_VALUE. Now, go ahead and make our new paragraph below.
