You are a recursive function call with current value 0.  instead of being written in a programming language you are written in English and the recursive call is made by creating an exact copy of  this paragraph of instructions. Then that new paragraph will itself create another new paragraph, and so on recursively. unless you are at the base case, the paragraph of instructions you generate will be an exact copy of this one with a very minor tweak. the goal of our function is to count from 0 to 3. our current value is 0 so when we generate the paragraph below we will first copy this current paragraph verbatim and then change its current value be incremented by 1. since this is recursion we also have a base case. our base case is when our current value gets to 3. So if that is true make the next paragraph simply be the word DONE. Now, please follow these instructions exactly and go ahead and make our new paragraph below. Remember it should be almost an exact copy of this one so it should start with "You are in a recursive" and end with the word word.
